        <h2>Why Track Roadkill?</h2>
        <p>
          Roadkill may be a routine occurrence, but it is not without
          consequences. Aside from delivering a pang of sadness or disgust to
          passing drivers, wildlife-vehicle collisions result in approximately
          365 million dead vertebrates per year in the United States alone
          <a
            href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/08034/04.cfm"
            >[1]</a
          >, and pose significant threats to endangered species. For example,
          roadkill accounts for 35% of annual deaths in the endangered Florida
          panthers <a href="https://doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-38.1.107">[2]</a>,
          and has resulted in the documented extinction of a local population of
          quolls in Tasmania, with a new population establishing itself
          following measures to reduce roadkill
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1071/WR98069">[3]</a>. That is, roadkill
          poses an existential threat to many of our most vulnerable species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, tracking roadkill provides valuable insights for a number of
          applications. Roadkill data, though biased toward ambulatory species,
          can elucidate species distributions, population trends, behavioral
          patterns, and even public health as a low-cost sampling method for
          environmental contaminants and vector-borne diseases
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-019-1357-4">[4]</a>. There is
          real utility in tracking roadkill.

          Boston is home to both charismatic and nuisance wildlife, including
          coyotes, raccoons, rabbits, squirrels, and—who could forget—rats.
          Whereas rural areas have largely been the subject of previous studies,
          urban and suburban settings like Boston have not received as much
          attention. Yet, urban wildlife interact with more humans more
          frequently and more intimately, whether we realize it or not. This
          project aims to understand the distribution of roadkill in Boston and
          its suburbs better, with immediate applications in roadkill reduction
          and long-term applications in urban ecology.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a roadkill reduction measure, our team has designed a prototype
          speed bump with an embedded tunnel, meant to both decrease traffic
          speed and to provide safe passage for small animals seeking to cross
          the road. We aim to identify roadkill hotspots for non-nuisance
          species in Boston to trial our speed bumps in.

        <h2>How You Can Contribute</h2>
        <p>
          You can contribute to a better understanding of roadkill in Boston's
          urban setting by taking a clear photo with your smartphone and
          submitting it below, along with the species identification.
        </p>
        <form class="roadkill-form">
          <div>
            <label for="species"
              >Species (enter "unidentifiable" if you cannot tell):</label
            >
            <input type="text" id="species" name="species" />
          </div>

          <div>
            <label for="photo">Upload photo:</label>
            <input type="file" id="photo" name="photo" accept="image/*" />
          </div>

          <input type="submit" class="submit" value="Submit (Disabled)" />
        </form>

        <p>
          We also need experts to verify species identifications. Please contact
          our team to discuss further.
